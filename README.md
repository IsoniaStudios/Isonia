# Isonia
The development repository for the Isonia game engine

Dont fear, nothing is to difficult
	Build a mountain

Clever is evil.
	Operator overloading
	Function overloading
	Built in features
	Templating

Crashes are good.
	There is no graceful handling of errors!

Abstraction is evil.
	Type, variable, function naming, be descriptive!
	Long functions are good! 
	Few but long header files are good!
	Strong types are good! (uint)

Premature optimizations is evil.
	
You spend more time reading your code than the compiler does.
	Ambiguity is the enemy

Create rules and follow them too the tea.
	Naming should follow a directory structure, ecsModuleObjectCreateInternal

You are an architect not a programmer.
	Start with how you use the code then write the code
	Find your primitives!

Pointers are your friend.
	Void pointers are good to hide internal data (typedef void Type)
	sizeof *p
	Pointer > reference
	Alignment by 4 makes things complicated
	Stride is good
	Pointers are UID's

Struct > class.
	Inherritence is just another struct at offset 0 recasted.

Memory is slow, code is fast
